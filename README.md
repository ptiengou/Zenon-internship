# Zenon-internship

This code presents two parts of a model used to conduct a study with Zenon Research, on the topic of low-latency teleoperation in future space exploration missions. 


The first file, sls_model.py, simulates a 3-stage rocket, using values similar to NASA's Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. Its objective was to obtain a ratio to compare the costs of a mission to the surface of the Moon (or Mars) and the cost of a mission to lunar (or martian) orbit, in terms of rocket fuel.


The second file, interface.py is a graphical interface used to simulate a low-latency teleoperation mission, and compare it to a high-latency mission. It uses the ratio computed using the other file, as well as other parameters, the can be chosen in the interface.
